<p>Enter a <a href="http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/webid/spec/#dfn-webid">WebID</a> into the following box, then 
    click to display its content. </p>
<form onsubmit="redraw($('#url').attr('value')); return false" action="GET">
    <input id="url" type="text" size="100" value="http://bblfish.net/people/henry/card#me">
    <input type="submit" value="display">
</form>
<p>The contents should be in a machine readable format (RDF/XML, Turtle, N3, RDFa) which this page will parse and
    then display a very small subsection of information with the
help of the <a href="https://github.com/linkeddata/rdflib.js">rdflib javascript library</a>.</p>
<p> Also since this
request is NOT passing though a proxy located on the same host as this page is served from, and
    since the embedded javascript will be fetching that file directly on the internet, the file will need to
    be <a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/CORS_Enabled">CORS enabled</a> if it is not coming from the same server as this
    file is. <i>CORS enabled</i> means it has to emmit the HTTP
header <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code> when it is served. I am not sure what the point of this 'security
restriction' is, if it is one at all. </p>

<p id="description">If you see this then fetching the remote profile did not succeed,
 or is not yet finished.</p>
<p>Below are the friends as linked to from that profile. Here we limit ourselves to
    simply name information and links. More information should be found
at the remote profile, which could be merged here and shown as a card too. But well, one
step at a time. </p>
