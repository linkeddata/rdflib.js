<h1>Using Turtle</h1>

<p>Turtle is a language.
  It is desiged for expressing data, partuicularly linked data on the web.
Just as HTML is used for linked text, Turtle is used for linked data.
Turtle expresses stuff about things.  Abstract things, real things, people,
documents,  So where HTML uses the hash sign like in <tt>foo.html#intro</tt>
to refer to an anchor, which is a part of the document, Turtle uses
the same hash sign to refer to something defined by the dococument, like <tt>students.ttl#bob</tt>
or <tt>profile.ttl#me</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Turtle is simple.  The data model it uses, called RDF, is simple.
Turtle was originally designed for writing in chat messages, and on whiteboards,
and making quick configuration files or test files, so it tries to be concise.
</p>
<pre>
  &lt;profile.ttl#me>   &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows>   &lt;students.ttl#bob>  .
</pre>
<p>
That is the simplest thing you can say in Turtle: one fact, one subject-verb-object triple.
Note it ends with a dot.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The data is sets of <i>triples</i>, or sentences with just a subject,
  a precdicate, and an object.  Like "I know bob".
</li>
<li> URIs like <tt>students.ttl#bob</tt> are used for the subjects, predicates and the objects.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
  <p>
    There is a shorthand <tt>a</tt> which you can use as a verb to give the class of a thing, to say what sort of thing it is.
    Classes, like properties,  also have URIs.
</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;profile.ttl#me>   a   &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person>  .
    </pre>
</p>
<h3>Prefixes</h3>
<p>Turtle uses URIs to identify people all the time, so it has a
  way of abbrevating them.
  You declare a prefix say at the top of the file, and then use <tt>foo:</tt> prefix with a colon:
  <pre>
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

&lt;profile.ttl#me>   a   foaf:Person  .
  </pre>
<p>
Tip: There are a ste of common prefixes for vocabularies we use a lot in @@@.
</p>

<p>When you use URIs in angle brackets, then they relative URIs, relative
to the URI of the current document.  So if the document is, say,
<tt>https://alice.example.com/public/profile.ttl</tt> then</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;#me></td>
    <td>means</td>
    <td>&lt;https://alice.example.com/public/profile.ttl#me></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;#myHome></td>
    <td>means</td>
    <td>&lt;https://alice.example.com/public/profile.ttl#myHome></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>&lt;students.ttl#bill></td>
    <td>means</td>
    <td>&lt;https://alice.example.com/public/students.ttl#bill></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Things like <tt>&lt;#me></tt> and <tt>&lt;myhome></tt> are local identifiers
  within the file you are creating. They are like <tt>const</tt> in a JS file
  in a way, local identifiers. The business of the data document you are writing
  is done in terms of those local identifiers.  Becasue local identifiers
  are used quite a lot, it is useful to declare a prefix, the empty string
  prefix <tt>:</tt>, so that they can be just written with a leading colon:
</p>
<pre>
  @prefix : &lt;#>.  # The empty prefix means this document

  :alice a :Person; :age 77 . # All local IDs
</pre>
<p>
  In what follows we will often assume a file starts with
</p>
<pre>
  @prefix : &lt;#>.
</pre>
<h3>Property trees</h3>

<p>As a shorthand, when you have more than one fact about the same subject, you
  can just use a semicolon <tt>";"</tt> to add more :

  <pre>
@prefix foaf: &lt;http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/> .

&lt;profile.ttl#me>   a   foaf:Person ;
          foaf:name "Alice";
          foaf:knows  &lt;students.ttl#bob> .
  </pre>
<p>You can also, when have multiple objects with the same subject <i>and</i>
   predicate, just list them with commas between them, so
 </p>

  <pre>
&lt;profile.ttl#me> a foaf:Person ;
                    foaf:knows  &lt;students.ttl#bob>,
                                &lt;students.ttl#charlie>,
                                &lt;students.ttl#david>;
                    foaf:name "Alice".
  </pre>
<p>means the same as:</p>
<pre>
  # Means the same as above
  &lt;profile.ttl#me> a           foaf:Person.
  &lt;profile.ttl#me> foaf:knows  &lt;students.ttl#bob>.
  &lt;profile.ttl#me> foaf:knows  &lt;students.ttl#charlie> .
  &lt;profile.ttl#me> foaf:knows  &lt;students.ttl#david>.
  &lt;profile.ttl#me> foaf:name   "Alice".
</pre>
<p>Periods are stronger than semicolons, which are stronger than commas, like in English.
</p>
<p>Turtle is a free form language: you can add or remove spaces and new lines
   anywhere.  Comments start with a hash sign.
</p>
<h3>Data Values</h3>

<p>Above we have shown the triples each expressing the ralationship between things: people
  and classes. You can also put data values in the object position, like the strng "Alice" above.
  In Turtle (and the RDF data model underneath) values are typed.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>"Alice"</td>
    <td>means the string Alice</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"20"</td>
    <td>means a string "20", not the number 20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20</td>
    <td>means the integer (whole number) 20.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>20.0</td>
    <td>means a decimal number</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2.0e1</td>
    <td>means a (double precision) floating point number 2*10^1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These data types cover a lot of values.
  You can also explictly write something
  with and explicit data type from the XML data types @@link standard, XSD.
  To do that you write the data value as a string, then two carets
  <tt>^^</tt> and then the XSD datatype itself.
</p>

<pre>
  @prefix xsd: &lt;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLShema#>.
  &lt;profile.ttl#me>   a   foaf:Person ;
                        foaf:name "Alice";
                        foaf:age  21;
                        foaf:height  1.76e0;
                        foaf:bithDate @@@ "1990-03-31"^^xsd:date .
</pre>

<p>Its also worth mentioning that URIs are yor freind if you wat to
  given email addresses or telephone numbers, as there are RI schemes for those.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
  <td>&lt;tel:+1781-555-1212></td>
  <td>How to do a phone number as a URI</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;mailto:alice@example.com></td>
<td>How to put in an email address.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Why give an explicit <tt>tel:</tt> URI or an explictly typed data field instead of
  just a string?  Because it means that the systems which re-use the data
  will be able to be smarter, to automatically pick the appropriate way of
  displaying it or converting into an other format, and so on.
  The tradition in linked data is stronger data typing, like Python or C rather than
  JS.
</p>

<h2>Structure</h2>
You can add structure to your data in Turtle using the square brackets <tt>[ ... ]</tt>,
which can be read as "Something which has ...".   So instead of a flat set of properties like
<pre>
  :Alice :homeAddressStreet "Accaia Ave";
         :homeAddressNumber 123;
         :homeAddressCity "Anytown";
         :homePhone &lt;tel:+1-781-555-1212> .
</pre>
<p>its best to add structure for the home and the address.</p>


<pre>
  :Alice :home [
            :address [
                :street "Accaia Ave";
                :number 123;
                :city "Anytown"
            ]
            :phone &lt;tel:+1-781-555-1212>
         ] .
</pre>
<p>This reads in English like "Alice has a home which has an address with
street "Aaccia Avenue", number 123 and city ANytown, and has a phone number of +1785551212."
<p>
<p>This sort of tree structure is very common: in JSON the nested things
  are objects; in XML they are elements. In Turtle they are called blank nodes,
  because they are not labelled with a URI.  There is another way of
  writing them in Turtle, where you make up local ids for them like <tt>_:foo</tt>
  to keep track of them but <b>these are not URIs</b>. The <tt>_:</tt>
    is a special one for blank nodes.
</p>
<pre>
:Alice :home _:a .
          _:a address _:b .
          _:b   street "Accaia Ave";
                number 123;
                city "Anytown" .
          _a :phone &lt;tel:+1-781-555-1212> .
</pre>
<p>
The square bracket syntax is obviously clearer.  You can use it in place of object or subject.
</p>

<h3>Lists</h3>
In turtle, ordered arrays of things are given with <b>round</b> brackets.
They are called collections or lists, and are like LISP lists, or
JS or Python arrays.
<pre>
<#alice>  foaf:children  ( &lt;#bob> &lt;#charlie>  &lt;#dave>  )  .
</pre>
<p>Imagine we store user input as a string, but separately generate the list of words.
</p>
<pre>
<#userInput>  ex:line   "turn on light";
              ex:inWords ("turn" "on" "light") .
</pre>
<h3>Conclusion
</h3>
<p>That's it.  That's all there is to turtle.  You now know it.
  It is good to get used to reading bits of turtle
  as though it was English.  Yu can now use it in code snippits in chats
  and in code for things like forms, configuration parameters, and so on.

  <h3>Extensions in rdflib</h3>
<p>There a few things which you should not use in data shared
  generally, but are shortcts for test data and quick scripts.
  rdflib.js will understand these sytatax but never generate them
</p>
<h4>Naked Dates</h4>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>
      :Alice foaf:birthdate 2018-02-31 .
    </pre>
  </td>
  <td>A raw ISO format date can be put in without explicit type</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre>
      :x4 :lastModifiedTime  2018-02-31T08:24:00.0Z .
    </pre>
  </td>
  <td>A raw ISO format date-time can be put in without explicit type</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h4>Reverse properties</h4>

<p>A good philosphy is that when there two relations which are inverse of
  each other, like <tt>parent</tt> and <tt>child</tt>, that we just use one,
  say  <tt>child</tt>, in the data, like
</p>
<pre>
  :grampa fam:child  :alice, :bob.
  :gramma fam:child  :alice, :bob.
  :alice  fam:child  :charlie, :davie, :ellie .
</pre>
<p>This makes the graph of relationships easier to query.
  In this example, you can infact express all the information about Alice at once:
</p>
<pre>
  :alice  is fam:child of :grampa, :gramma;
          fam:child :charlie, :davie, :ellie .
</pre>
<p>The <tt>is</tt> ... <tt>of</tt> syntax was in the original N3 language
  which Turtle was derived from but unfortunately left out of the turtle standard.
</p>
<h4>Local document prefix</h4>
<p>It is handy to define the empty string prefix <tt>:</tt>
  as being for the local document, so it can be used for local identifiers.
</p>
<pre>
@prefix : &lt;#>.
</pre>
<p>This is in fact assumed by default by rdflib.js
  so you can miss it out.
</p>

<pre>
  :this a :Example; :age 123.
</pre>
  <p>is a fine test file.</p>
