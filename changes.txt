## 2025-11-04 - Fix for parsing Turtle files with dots in terms

Fixed issue #601: Parser now correctly handles dots within local names (e.g., ex:subject.example)
without consuming the statement terminator dot. The fix distinguishes between dots that are part
of a name and dots that serve as statement terminators by checking if the dot is followed by
whitespace, a comment, or end-of-file.

Changes:
- Parser (src/n3parser.js): Modified bareWord() and qname() to allow dots inside names unless
  followed by whitespace/comment/EOF, preventing misinterpretation as path operators.
- Serializer (src/serializer.js): Added '.' to _notQNameChars to prevent incorrect abbreviation
  of URIs containing dots (e.g., https://subject.example stays as <https://subject.example>
  instead of being split into a fake qname like n0:subject.example).
- Tests: Added tests/unit/dot-in-term-test.ts covering parse and serialize behavior with dots.

All 257 tests passing.

================================================================================

REMOVED FILES:

plistClosure.js -> no refs to about() or pickOne.
unify.js        -> contained _no_ code !
remote.js       -> remoteQuery ref'd in query.js, but commented out.
parser.js       -> not used anymore.

LOGGING:

Without assuming that there is a global log var, logging can be weird. What do we do?
(bring in the log js)

ORDERING:

util.js - done (util-nonlib.js) - FIGURE OUT AJAR_HandleNew  (should be in sources probably..) for now in util class.
uri.js  - done (REMOVED URIjoin, uri_docpart, uri_protocol
term.js - done..
rdfparser.js -done..
n3parser.js  -ew, but done.
identity.js  21k -RDFArrayRemove now in Util.RDFArrayRemove.

sources.js   37k -ok??
serialize.js 24k -OK!
sparqlUpdate.js 8k -ok, seemingly.
sparql.js      21k -SPARQLtoQuery needs kb in calls to it now.. isbnode: /^[]$/ -> /^$/ NO! Take it back.

TODO: Add the minor sources bugfix into sources.js!
